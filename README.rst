Description and scope of the project.

Building and Running
====================

To get started with local development. Download and install Microsoft Visual
Studio Code and the Remote Containers extension. Then open the project in
Visual Studio Code and click the "Reopen in Container" button in the bottom
right corner of the window.

Once the container is built and running, you will now have a Visual Studio code
session running inside the container. It includes the same dependencies as the
production environment plus some additional tools for development and testing.
However, the project remains to be built. To build the project, run the
following command in the terminal::

    scripts/build
